*INF4000: Data visualization*

The INF4000 project explores the intricate relationship between data analytics and the art of music. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset on song metadata and lyrics, this study investigates the quantitative features and lyrical themes that contribute to a song's popularity. By employing advanced visualization techniques, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling, the project provides actionable insights into how artists and producers can better understand the preferences of their audiences. This work bridges the gap between data-driven strategies and the creative process, offering a unique perspective on the dynamics of the music industry.

The visualizations in this research will help to answer the following research questions:
- What do visualizations reveal about the distribution of song features between hit songs and non-hit songs?
- How can the genre visualization help to identify the features that influence song popularity?
- What patterns in lyrical themes create successful songs?
